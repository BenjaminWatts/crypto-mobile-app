# Coin App
This app was created using the Tabs starter from Expo-router (`npx create-expo-app@latest --template tabs@49`).

## Navigation

Expo-router handles navigation for the app. The screens outlined in the requirements have the following routes:

1. Home: `/`
2. Favourites `/favourites`
3. Information `/coin/{id}`, where `id` is a coin id from the Coin-Gecko Api.


## Testing

Tests can either be run:

1. `yarn test` - on a unit basis
2. `yarn e2e` - on an end to end basis
